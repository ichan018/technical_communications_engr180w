# Smart Fridge
## About
In 2020, Ivan Chan and Chengyue Lin created a technical documentation documentation for the ENGR 180W: Technical Communications class at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). 

We did not build the Smart Fridge. We only made a document explaining the specifications of the smart fridge. The name "Tuesday Electronics, Inc." is not a real company. It is a fictional company that we used for the purposes of the project.

This repository was created by Ivan Chan. The README.md file was written by Ivan Chan.

## Summary
In Section 1.4, we created a product scope which described which aspects of our Smart Fridge are "In Scope" or "Out of Scope".

In Section 2.1, we created a product perspective with a diagram that shows what our refrigerator can do.

In Section 2.2, we listed the functions that our refrigerator can do.

In Section 4, we listed the features and functions of our product (refrigerator). We described each feature, explained the importance of the feature, added expected behaviors, and listed functional requirements.

For example, one of the features was the touchscreen.

The description of the touchscreen was as follows:

The stimulus/response sequences (how the touchscreen should behave, is as follows:)
