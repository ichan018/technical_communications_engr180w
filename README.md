# Smart Fridge
## About
In 2020, Ivan Chan and Chengyue Lin created a technical documentation documentation for the ENGR 180W: Technical Communications class at the University of California, Riverside (UCR). 

We did not build the Smart Fridge. We only made a document explaining the specifications of the smart fridge. The name "Tuesday Electronics, Inc." is not a real company. It is a fictional company that we used for the purposes of the project.

This repository was created by Ivan Chan. The README.md file was written by Ivan Chan.

## Summary
In Section 1.4, we created a product scope which described which aspects of our Smart Fridge are "In Scope" or "Out of Scope".
